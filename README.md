## Basketball-Trivia-Game

#DESCRIPTION
Welcome to our project! Our project is going to be a game called Basketball Trivia! Basketball Trivia is a great game where you can put your knowledge of the National Basketball Association to the test. The way this game works is the player is going to be presented with a 3x3 grid with prompts/descriptions of either teams or statistics displayed on the horizontal and vertical sides of the grid. The goal of the game is to come up with a player name that corresponds to the descriptions on both the horizontal and vertical axes. 

#PACKAGE INSTALLATION

HOW TO PLAY
The goal of the game is to fill out all 9 squares with names of the players which entail to the descriptions that the game provides. Once the game has started you are able to click each square and enter the names of the players that you have a knowledge of. Once you are finished typing out the name, be sure to hit the enter key and the game will display a message of whether or not you were able to get the correct answer. Once you have completed answering all 9 squares of the grid, you are going to be prompted with an option to exit the game, by pressing X.
